The POC application was enhanced into a minimum viable product to handle the large volume
of location data by adding two location modules that combine Kafka and gRPC message passing techniques. 

Firstly, acquired location data from clients are send by gRPC messages to Kafka producer
defined in location-producer-grpc-kafka module and connected to Kafka broker. 

Secondly, Kafka broker directs location data to Kafka consumer defined in location-consumer-module
and finally saves data into location table. 

Clients request data via frontend module using RESTful API calls for person and connection endpoints.
Considering simple functionality and lack of business logic there is no need to split api module into
microservices, but with added location modules is possible to scale acquisition of location data.
